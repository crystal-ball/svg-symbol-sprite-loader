# Contributing Guide for üîÆ Projects

_üëã Welcome and thank you for contributing, you are awesome üéâ_

## Code of Conduct

Please read the repository [Code of Conduct][], we take it seriously and
contributors are required to adhere to the guidelines.

## Code authoring

This project uses ESLint and Prettier to make writing consistent code easy.
Formatting and linting can be run with npm commands:

```sh
# Format the project with Prettier
npm run format

# Lint the project with ESLint
npm run test:lint
```

Commit messages are generated with [Commitizen][] to make writing consistent
commit messages easy. On commit a Husky pre-commit hook will start an
interactive terminal session to step through each part of the commit message
with prompts.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Commitizen commit messages make it possible to use Semantic Release to
> automatically publish packages on change to master.

## Repo setup

1. webpack loader `svg-symbol-sprite-loader` that allows importing SVG files
   into a webpack project.
1. webpack plugin that aggregates the imported SVGs into a separate `<symbol>`
   sprite file and emits it as a build asset.
1. _Optional_ `local-storage-svg-loader.js` that will fetch an SVG sprite and
   save it to local storage using the asset id. On subsequent visits to your
   application if the sprite id hasn't changed the sprite will be served from
   local storage.

## Roadmap

_‚ÑπÔ∏è Roadmap items track long term project goals, see the [ZenHub board][] for
ready to work issues._
